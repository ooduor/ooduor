### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring Digital Humanist. I enjoy writing code and building things using web technologies. Things that create/save/reclaim my time and other people's time. My repertoire of languages and markup tools include Python, Javascript, HTML, XML, CSS, XQuery. I'm currently learning [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) and [Ember](https://emberjs.com/) for building robust user-experiences. I love open-source software and everything it stands for. I use and contribute where I can by fixing bugs, suggesting new features or adding Swahili translations for localization.
